## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This challenge helped me to reinforce my knowledge and find new solutions.

A very interesting property is to center elements.
```css
place-items: center;
```
This is shorthand for the `align-items` and `justify-items` properties, combining them into a single declaration.


### Continued development

After this challenge, I would like to focus on improving some themes for future projects, such as responsive design and mobile-first workflow.
*I had some problems during the practice.*

### Useful resources

- [place-items](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/p/place-items/) - This helped me to center the elements. I really liked this property and will use it in the future.
